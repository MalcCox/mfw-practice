        <h3>I'm 47 years old, born in the wonderful Country of England under a rain filled sky many moons ago.
          I came to American in 1997 after meeting a girl in an AOL chat room .. we have been married for 22 years and going strong.
          I have three passions in my life my Family and pets, my Camero convertible which we just got last year and im a WoW geek.
          2020 has gotten off to a rather rough start for me, i was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes two weeks ago so i'm getting used to the new way of life. No soda, no alcohol and a whole new menu to live by. My eye sight has gone to pot in just the last few weeks as i adjust to the new meds etc. So if you see me straining you'll understand why. I cant get new glasses until my levels are where they need to be.
          After all that i'm just a fun loving guy, have a great sense of humor but may come over a little sarcastic from time to time ... oops
